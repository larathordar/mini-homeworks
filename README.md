Sqlite only has 5 supported datatypes but Postgres has 22 supported datatypes. Therefore PostgresSQL has more options to work with. when making applications where multiple clients need to access and use the same database as we are doing in our assignments SQLite is not a good option, as it does not come with user management support like PostgresSQL does.
